                <h1>family matters </h1>
                <p>A family is made strong through a number of factors. The most important one is of course love. You
                    instantly think of unconditional love when you think of family. It is the first source of love you
                    receive in your life It teaches you the meaning of love which you carry on forever in your heart.
                </p>
                <p>Most importantly, the things one learns from their family brings them closer. For instance, we learn how to deal with the world through our family first. They are our first school and this teaching strengthens the bond. It gives us reason to stand by each other as we share the same values.</p>
